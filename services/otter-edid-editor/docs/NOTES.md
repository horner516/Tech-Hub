# Notes

Working notes for this repo: status, decisions, and the traps that have actually bitten.
Migrated out of Claude Code's memory on 2026-08-24, so they are written in the first
person and dated by when each thing was learned — that date is usually the useful part.

Cross-cutting notes that are not specific to this repo live in

*Otter EDID Editor — browser EDID builder/editor with a cited per-model hardware support matrix; PUBLIC + LIVE as a beta, but no hardware has ever been fed one of its EDIDs*

**Otter EDID Editor** — `~/projects/video/otter-edid-editor`, React/TS/Vite static
SPA, MIT, v0.1.0, created 2026-08-20. Same shape as the browser-tool family
([blend calc](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/blend-calc/blob/main/docs/NOTES.md) (`blend-calc`), [aspect calc](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/aspect-calc/blob/main/docs/NOTES.md) (`aspect-calc`), [test card](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/test-card/blob/main/docs/NOTES.md) (`test-card`)):
no backend, Cloudflare static-assets Worker, `otter.stoatworks-labs.com` in
`wrangler.toml`. **PUBLIC and LIVE since 2026-08-20**: `github.com/stoatworks-labs/otter-edid-editor`
(MIT, branch `main`) and **https://otter-edid.stoatworks-labs.com** — a
static-assets Worker with the custom domain declared in `wrangler.toml`, so a
fresh deploy cannot come up without the hostname. Listed on the website as a
**beta** on `/software/otter-edid-editor` and `/web-tools` (position 08, Video
group).

Named by Allan mid-build (was `edid-forge` for about an hour — any pre-rename
path is dead).

**Two modes + two answers.** Simple mode: resolution + rate + name → a whole
EDID 1.4. Advanced mode: every field, incl. CTA-861 and DisplayID 2.0. Right
column always shows (a) the minimum HDMI/DP/DVI version the mode needs and
(b) a per-model support matrix, 21 devices, Analog Way / Barco / PixelHue /
Brompton / NovaStar / disguise / Green Hippo.

**Containerised 2026-08-20**: `fleet.json` `static-build` + `unraid.json`
`hostPort` **8529**, public, in [stoatworks unraid](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/stoatworks-unraid/blob/main/docs/NOTES.md) (`stoatworks-unraid`). Image
`ghcr.io/stoatworks-labs/otter-edid-editor` built green and verified
**anonymously pullable** (token + manifest GET — a green Actions run does not
prove it). linux/amd64, matching the rest of the fleet. CA template live at
`templates/otter-edid-editor.xml`. The generated Dockerfile runs `nginx -t`
during the build, which is the only syntax check these configs get
([no container runtime](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/fleet-notes/blob/main/notes/reference_no_container_runtime.md)).

**Carries the shared support footer** ([support footer](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/fleet-notes/blob/main/notes/reference_support_footer.md)) with
`data-repo` set, so it links its own GitHub source — which the five sibling
browser tools still do not.

**`scripts/serve-dist.py` was missing for the repo's first day.** package.json
referenced `npm run serve:dist` from the first commit because the script block
was copied from blend-calc, but the file was never brought across — so the one
way to check the CSP locally could not run. Copied in 2026-08-20. Worth checking
in any repo scaffolded the same way.

**Dependabot: all three toggles ON since 2026-08-20** — `vulnerability-alerts`,
`automated-security-fixes`, and `.github/dependabot.yml` copied verbatim from
blend-calc rather than reinvented. See [dependabot fleet config](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/fleet-notes/blob/main/notes/reference_dependabot_fleet_config.md).

**"Beta" on this site is carried in the tool's NAME, not its status.**
`projects.json.statuses` has no `beta` tier, and an undeclared id falls through
to the raw lowercase string with no `.status-*` colour. So: `status: "building"`
plus `"name": "Otter EDID Editor (beta)"` / `"navLabel": "Otter EDID (beta)"` in
`webtools.json`, which is how the PLAY Flasher does it. ⚠️ **`burin` really does
carry `status: "beta"` and therefore renders unstyled** — a latent bug, not a
precedent to copy.

**The features Allan added mid-build, in order:** required HDMI/DP version
readout; DSC and VRR as toggles that feed BOTH the bandwidth maths and the
emitted EDID; the Aquilon DP 1.4 port-preemption warning
([aquilon dp14 port preemption](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/fleet-notes/blob/main/notes/reference_aquilon_dp14_port_preemption.md)).

**Three things that cost real time and are pinned by tests:**

- **CVT standard blanking must use the ESTIMATED line period throughout.**
  Recomputing it against the settled vertical total is the obvious-looking
  improvement and moves the clock off every published DMT value (1680x1050@60
  came out 146.75 instead of 146.25). The estimate IS the definition.
- **A DTD's limits are NOT just the 655.35 MHz clock.** Active and blanking are
  12-bit fields, porches 10- and 6-bit. `8192x1080@60` has an unremarkable
  551 MHz clock and still cannot be a DTD — and Analog Way advertise exactly
  that format on the Aquilon input cards. `dtdLimit()` checks every field and
  routes such modes to DisplayID Type VII. Found by a test, not by inspection.
- **Device capacity-mode inheritance must be an explicit `inheritsFrom` id.**
  Matching on `family` handed the Barco EX chassis the E2 *Gen 1* dual-cable
  answer and stated it as fact; EX takes either generation. No modes + no
  pointer now reports `unknown`.

**DisplayID 2.0 Type VII layout was verified byte-for-byte against the Linux
kernel**, not written from spec prose: `drm_displayid_internal.h` (structs +
`DATA_BLOCK_2_*` tags; Type VII = 0x22, Interface Features = 0x26) and
`drm_mode_displayid_detailed()` in `drm_edid.c`. **Every count is stored
minus one** — an off-by-one there looks like a bad cable, not a bad EDID.
git.linuxtv.org and gitlab.freedesktop.org are both behind Anubis and refuse
WebFetch; raw.githubusercontent.com + `gh api` worked.

**The honest gap: no EDID this tool produces has ever been fed to hardware,**
and the whole capability table is vendor paperwork. `devices.ts` carries a
`Confidence` of documented / inferred / unverified plus mandatory citations
(a test fails the build if a `documented` row has none). PDS-902 is a deliberate
`unverified` placeholder with no citation. README and AGENTS.md say all of this
plainly; don't let a later pass quietly upgrade it.

Primary local sources: `~/Downloads/livecore-unit-user-manual-uk.pdf` and
`~/Downloads/user-manual-pulse2.pdf` (`pdftotext -layout`). LiveCore = 165 MHz
single-link / 330 MHz dual; **that cap applies to its HDMI plug too**, not the
340 MHz HDMI 1.4 allows — using the spec limit made the tool claim a NeXtage
takes 2560x1600.

**Two JSON files next door use OPPOSITE escaping conventions**, and a
`json.dumps` with the wrong one rewrites untouched lines: `scripts/shots.json`
stores `\u2014` escapes (`ensure_ascii=True`), `src/data/webtools.json` and
`src/data/projects.json` store literal UTF-8 (`ensure_ascii=False`). Check
before rewriting either, and confirm with `git diff --numstat` that the change
is insertions-only.

**`make_screens.py` also produced four heroes nobody had ever committed** —
abomerration, burin, tilter, vectrix each had a `shots.json` entry and no image,
so their pages had been falling back to the branded thumbnail. Committed
separately. Expect more of these; the run is the only thing that surfaces them.

**A brand-new asset 404s at the Worker origin for ~30 seconds after deploy.**
Both the new thumbnail and hero returned the 404 page immediately after
`wrangler deploy` and were 200 on a retry twenty seconds later. Do not go
hunting for a missing-file bug — retry first. (This is *not* the zone-cache
trap from [stoatworks website](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/stoatworks-website/blob/main/docs/NOTES.md) (`stoatworks-website`); it happens on the workers.dev origin.)

Sibling: [openrcs](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/openrcs/blob/main/docs/NOTES.md) (`openrcs`) has a device-side EDID *writer* (pushes EDID to AW
input plugs). Different thing; this is a standalone editor.

**Mosaic mode landed 2026-09-23** — Allan asked for multi-plug tiled EDIDs so a Mac's
outputs are frame synced, and pointed at a reference tiled-EDID builder Allan supplied (not
named here by request). `src/lib/mosaic.ts` is **byte-identical** to it, pinned by
fixtures generated by running the reference under node with Otter's id. What its
source says it learned on the bench, and what this mode repeats:

- **Only its reference base+CTA bonded.** A PixelHue Q8 EDID, patched in six places.
  The reference's first version synthesised base+CTA and no Mac ever bonded on those files. So
  nothing in the reference is tidied, and Otter's own encoder never touches a tile —
  its CTA encoder reordered data blocks, so a decode/encode of that block changed 88
  bytes (found while checking the round-trip, not by inspection; fixed the same
  day — see below — but the bypass stays).
- **DisplayID 1.3, not 2.0.** Section version 0x12, a Type I timing (tag 0x03, 10 kHz
  clock) then Tiled Display (tag 0x12), section length declared as the full 121 with
  zero padding. Otter's decoder now keeps that declared length (`sectionLength`) —
  without it a round-trip shortened the section and moved three bytes.
- **macOS limits:** a bonded canvas is up to 6144 wide on macOS 26, up to 12288 on 27
  (12288 is also the E3's DisplayID ceiling, so 27's real limit is unknown). Only
  2 x 1 and 2 x 2 bond; 3- and 4-wide never. 2 x 2 fed by an **Encore 3 on 10.3**
  drops connector hotplug (Barco "Defect 1"). *Re-read against field reports on
  2026-10-20, below: 6144 is the 50/60 Hz figure, not a hard cap.*
- **The macOS 27 release notes say nothing about any of this.** The only related entry
  is a fix for two identical displays (same model and serial) where the second stayed
  dark. Apple's release-notes pages are JS-rendered; `developer.apple.com/tutorials/data/
  documentation/macos-release-notes/<page>.json` is the readable form.
- Tiled block layout checked against `drm_parse_tiled_block` (kernel), including the
  high count/location bits in byte 3 — which the reference leaves at zero, fine below 16.
- **Topology id is Stoatworks' own: `SWK`, product 0x4F54.** SWK is unassigned in the
  UEFI PNP registry (`uefi.org/uefi-pnp-export`, a CSV). The reference used ATV — which
  the registry assigns to Office Depot. Untested whether the Mac cares.

Still true: **Otter has not loaded any of these into a Mac itself.**

**A decoded CTA block saves back byte for byte since 2026-09-23.** The Q8 block broke
the encoder two ways: its data blocks run video, audio, HDMI Forum VSDB, HDMI VSDB,
video capability (the encoder puts HDMI before Forum and capability mid-list), and its
HDMI Forum VSDB is 7 bytes where the encoder always writes the optional 8th (the
ALLM/VRR flags byte). Either one moves the DTD offset, so every byte after it shifts.
The fix records each block's key, bytes and a canonical (sorted-key) serialisation of
the fields it decoded into, in `CtaExtension.source`; the encoder emits a block's
original bytes while its fields still serialise the same. The UI edits by spreading,
which is why the comparison ignores key order. All 12 mosaic fixture tiles (384 bytes,
base + CTA + DisplayID 1.3) failed a whole-EDID round-trip before this and pass after.
Still lossy on purpose: **editing** a block re-encodes it from the model, so bytes the
model does not carry (HDMI VSDB latency fields, reserved bits) go with that edit.
Also seen: the reference's base block claims two extensions (byte 126) for a 256-byte
blob, because mosaic appends the third; the encoder writes the count it has.

**Mosaic widths re-read against field reports, 2026-10-20.** Someone asked through the
feedback button whether an M5 could do 2 × 8192 × 2160 (stoatworks-triage#6), and Otter
refused any tile over 6144. The research turned up more than the reference had:

- **6144 is the 50/60 Hz figure before macOS 27.** BetterDisplay discussion #713 has
  7680 × 4320 @30 (two 3840 × 4320 tiles) bonding on an M2 Max (2023-10) and an M4 Max
  (2025-08), while 2 × 3840 × 2160 @60 did not; PixelHue's Mac Mosaic notes say 7680
  works "on M2 and above". The chip list is inferred from who reported it. Monterey
  bonded 7680 × 2304 @60 on an M1 Max and Ventura cut it to 6144.
- **12288 on macOS 27 was the Barco E3's ceiling, not macOS's.** Nobody has reported a
  bonded canvas wider than that, or a bonded tile wider than 6144, on any Mac.
- **Inferred, from third-party reads of M4 and M5 display firmware** (smcleod.net,
  BetterDisplay #2174): one display pipe is at most 7680 wide (`MaxSrcRectWidthForPipe`)
  and the source buffer 16384. An 8192 tile would need two pipes joined, as 8K does.
- So `mosaicErrors` no longer refuses a wide tile. `checkMosaic` warns ("Nobody has
  shown a Mac bonding tiles 8192 wide") and a canvas past 12288 is a caveat, not a "no".
- **New: a tile-clock warning.** The copied range-limits descriptor (`fd 00 17 f0 0f ff
  3c`) says 600 MHz at most, and Otter had been building 12288 × 2160 @60 (840.45 MHz a
  tile) and 2 × 8192 × 2160 @60 (1113.49) without a word. It warns past 600 now. The
  descriptor stays byte-identical, and the reference fixtures still pin it.
  2 × 8192 × 2160 @30 is 548.98 MHz, under the line.
- **Also a line-rate warning**, the same day. The descriptor's other ceiling is 255 kHz
  (byte 80, `ff`), pinned by a test the same way. A 2160-tall tile crosses it at about
  112 Hz, a 4320-tall one at about 57.5 (7680 × 4320 @60 as 2 × 1 is 266.58 kHz a tile).
  It is a separate warning because a narrow tile can cross it with the clock still under
  600 MHz: 3840 × 2160 @120 as 2 × 1 is 274 kHz at 570.84 MHz.
- **Fixed the same day: tall tiles wrapped the stand-in's height.** A tile taller than
  4095 (7680 × 4320 as 2 × 1, the layout in the 30 Hz reports) wrote the base block's
  stand-in DTD with its 12-bit height wrapped: 3840 × 224, and a 4096-tall tile 0 lines.
  The stand-in was only ever halved for width. The reference builder does exactly the
  same (it halves `sw` and never `sh`), so its bytes for tall tiles were never a tested
  reference either, and none of the five fixture cases is taller than 2160. Otter now
  halves the height too (3840 × 4320 → 3840 × 2160 at the same rate), and `baseDtd`
  throws rather than wrap if anything ever gets past it. The fixtures still match byte
  for byte. Refusing tall tiles was the other option, but that would have refused the
  one layout people report bonding at 30 Hz. A side effect: 7680 × 4320 @60 as 2 × 1
  builds now; its full-height stand-in needed 1066 MHz and used to throw. The DisplayID
  Type I timing, which is what a Mac bonds on, was always right.
- **Not a bug, just odd:** the stand-in's sync byte is `1e` (both syncs positive) in every
  tile the reference built, while the Type I timing says V negative. It is the reference's
  byte, so the fixtures pin it.
- **Found, not fixed:** the stand-in's clock still has to fit a DTD's 655.35 MHz, and
  halving for size does not always get it there. 7680 × 2160 as 2 × 1 refuses to build
  from about 72 Hz, 6144 × 2160 from 90 Hz. The UI says so ("Can't build this") rather
  than writing a wrapped clock. Every rate anyone reports bonding is under that.

LivePremier Plus vendors the embed build, so a change here goes there too: `npm run
build:embed`, commit `dist-embed/`, then its `npm run sync:otter-edid`.
